### With Python
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
```bash
python server.py
```

### With Docker Compose
Build and run the pyapi application, along with `postgres` and `rabbitmq`:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

You can change the code and/or `.env` files located in the Docker directory to change the behavior of the application.
